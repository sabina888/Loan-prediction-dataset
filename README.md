Loan Approval Prediction Model
In this model, we built a loan approval model in which we can determine whether a person should get a loan or not, and is based on various factors.

We can define a loan as a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in exchange for future repayment of the value or principal amount. In many cases, the lender also adds interest or finance charges to the principal value, which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal balance. (credit: Investopedia)
